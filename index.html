                Meditation is a practice that can help us become more aware of our thoughts, feelings, and sensations in the present moment. For beginners, it's important to start with basic meditation techniques that can help them develop a foundation for their practice, such as breath awareness, body scan, and loving-kindness meditation.</p>
